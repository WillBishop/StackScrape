# StackScrape
Download all questions and answers from a certain tag off Stackoverflow

#How to use
I assume you all know how to clone a Github repo, but if not:

`git clone https://github.com/WillBishop/StackScrape` should do the job

`python3 StackScrape.py python` <-- Replace Python will your perferred tag.

This will download them all into the current directory, so please make a new folder for the script.
